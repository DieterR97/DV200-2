# PureHealth Medical Solution
### DV200 PHP and SQL
#### INTERACTIVE DEVELOPMENT 200 | TERM 2

## About the Project
* ### Project Description

This term we explored the concept, setup and implementation of persistent data structures and languages. We learned to create and modify databases, store and retrieve information in those databases and generate web pages from the retrieved data. We also set up a local development environment, and use it to administer code and data.

This final project is a data driven web application using PHP and MySQL.

I was tasked with researching, analysing, implementing and visualising a data set (From a database) with PHP and MySQL.

We had to create a receptionist portal where one could imlement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality on Doctors, Patients, Receptionists and Appointments.

## Features and Functionality

This web application has:
   
   1. A Login Page.
   2. A dasboard to view this weeks appointments.
   3. A page for Doctors, Receptionists and Patients where all CRUD functionality can be executed.

## Development Process
* ### Implementation Process
    * Highlights
      * MySQl is fun and easy to use once you get the hang of how to structure queries
      * A good looking and well functioning web application can be created with PHP and a database
      * PHP is a secure way of the client-server side of things
      * PHP and MySQL works well together
      * PHP can create awesome functionality for your web application
    * Challenges
      * Getting started with query structuring can be tricky but gets easier the more you play with it
      * PHP syntax and how it works with HTML is a bit challenging at the beginning

## Future Implementation

In the future I will implement more functionality into my web application and more security features and as well as more form validation. I will also change it that so that when a new profile image is chosen the old one gets deleted and doesn't fill up the project folder

## Conclusion

I have enjoyed problem solving and developing the web application from the ground up. This was a challenging project but I overcame most of the challenges I faced and Iâ€™m extremely proud of and pleased with the final outcome of my Receptionist Portal web application. Working with PHP and MySQL was a challenge but also interesting and I learned quite a bit from it.

Learning PHP was awesome along with MySQL.

I will deffinitely be using the technologies learned from throughout the term in future web applications.
